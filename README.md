# TNNI-Mouse: Triton NeuroTech Neural Interface Aided Control of Computer Displays

## No surface, no constraints, the EMG computer mouse 
Do you spends hundreds of dollars on ergonomic computing wear? Ever wish you could reach the third dimension which you as a human are entitled to?

In today's era of advanced technology, the traditional computer mouse can seem a bit archaic. Issues like hand cramping, neck pain, and limitations for those with restricted mobility are calling for a change. That's why we've embarked on a journey to build a low-cost, 4-channel neural interface EMG input device, a helpful tool that promises to overcome these limitations. Our project's goal is simple yet ambitious: To make brain-computer interfaces more accessible. To this end, we've designed an EMG armband that collects signals from muscle contractions.

## Getting started 

### Hardware 
Equipment:
- OpenBCI Cyton 
- HiLetGo MPU-9250 Accelerometer 
- TNNI armband and electrodes (Make it yourself with instructions found <a href="https://www.notion.so/Setting-up-the-armband-v1-cedfd5e207a040f49cadb870782e4840">here</a>
	- View additional electode designs and corresponding CAD files <a href="https://www.notion.so/Electrode-designs-testing-02a77889273f4634abf1a4feb5045396#66735a91fc4a40858078af40cb69c2ef">here</a>

Set up:
1. Make sure your Cyton is on and dongle is plugged in
2. Open the OpenBCI GUI app
3. Turn on LSL streaming for timeseries data

### Software 
Clone this repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/NeuroTech-UCSD/Project-TNNI-ACD.git
```
Download the dependencies
```
cd TNNI-ACD
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And run the code! 
```
python scripts/main.py
```

## User centric design

### Adjust your sensitivity and activity length: 

<u>Check the optional arguments</u>: 

```
python scripts/main.py -h
``` 
<u>Customizable options</u>:

**- Sensitvity**: Sensitivity of cursor movements out of 10 where 1 is least sensitive and 10 is most. Default is 5 <p>
**- Activity Time**: For user convenience, adjust in seconds of how long EMG mouse will be on. Default is 60 seconds. <p>

## GitHub Directory 
Written in Python and C, our software interprets all the inputs from the EMG armband and translates them into accurate and smooth computer control efficiently. In our main file, we use an LSL stream to get EMG data from the electrodes and a serial stream to get inertial data from the IMU. Each stream is fed into its own thread where sampling, processing, and GUI calls can occur independently. This will optimize speed and synchronization of the cursor outputs. Each thread follows a similar pipeline: data is pulled, sent through the respective processing functions previously described, and its output calls a change to the cursor, either movement or a click. Utilizing the pyautogui package, we are able to incorporate the calls to change the cursor within our python script.
