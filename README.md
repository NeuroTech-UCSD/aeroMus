# TNNI-Mouse: Triton NeuroTech Neural Interface Aided Control of Computer Displays

## No surface, no constraints, the EMG computer mouse 
Ever wish you could reach the third dimension which you as a human are entitled to? Do you spends hundreds of dollars on ergonomic computing wear? 
#TODO make sales pitch and project overview

## Video 
<todo add link>


## Getting started 

### Hardware 
Equipment:
- OpenBCI Cyton 
- HiLetGo <insert info> Accelerometer 
- TNNI armband and electrodes (Make it yourself with the specs in `/directory`)  #TODO ADD path

Set up 
1. Make sure your Cyton is on and dongle is plugged in
2. open OpenBCI GUI app
3. Turn on LSL streaming for timeseries data

### Software 
Clone this repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/NeuroTech-UCSD/Project-TNNI-ACD.git
```
Download the dependencies
```
cd TNNI-ACD
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And run the code! 
```
python scripts/main.py
```

## User centric design

### Adjust your sensitivity and activity length: 

<u>Check the optional arguments</u>: 

```
python scripts/main.py -h
``` 
<u>Customizable options</u>:

**Sensitvity**: Sensitivity of cursor movements out of 10 where 1 is least sensitive and 10 is most. Default is 5 <p>
**Activity Time**: For user convenience, adjust in seconds of how long EMG mouse will be on. Default is 60 seconds. <p>

## Usage 
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.
- In [`/scripts`](https://github.com/NeuroTech-UCSD/Project-Template/tree/main/scripts), `python main.py` will run the app.
- Upload the entire project folder to Google drive, and open the .ipynb files in Colab to run the demo notebooks.
